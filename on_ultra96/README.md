After the pynq-dpu is installed, import the files in this directory into the main directory of pynq-dpu.
The programs in folder "Measurement_Inference" are about measuring the inference execution time of various CNN models.

## Example
Before running these measurement programs, you need to import the compiled corresponding .xmodel files into the corresponding paths. 
For example, create a new folder called `vgg16_xmodel` in the directory `/Measurement_Inference/`
And then import the .xmodel file of vgg16 into `/vgg16_xmodel`
